## Summary:

My name is Oksana. I am 33 years old.

After completing my university degree, I got a job in sales industry. Working as a sales manager for a while I have shown commitment to my daily duties, with a big desire to learn and develop new skills which resulted in a promotion to a higher position as a of head of the wholesale department.

Despite enjoying working in the sales department and having a successful career I do like to explore new opportunities and skills in other fields too. I believe I have a naturally organized mindset and great eye for detail when it comes to working with data structures and algorithms. For this reason, I would like to change my career for something I would enjoy more, which is learning to become a Front-End developer. This will offer endless opportunities and personal development which I seek in my life.

I look forward to exploring the new knowledge RSSchool is kindly providing and will work extremely hard in becoming a Front-End developer!
